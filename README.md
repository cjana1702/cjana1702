### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Venkata Chaitanya Jana, a passionate Data Scientist and Software Engineer currently pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science at Stony Brook University. With a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from GITAM University, I've honed a strong foundation in both software and data-driven technologies.

My professional journey includes impactful roles such as an Automation and AI Intern at State Street and a Machine Learning Engineer at Phoenix Global. These experiences have equipped me with a deep understanding of AI, machine learning, and automation, enabling me to develop innovative solutions for complex challenges.

I am skilled in Python, R, SQL, and familiar with frameworks like OpenCV, Keras, and TensorFlow. My project work reflects a commitment to leveraging data for insightful decision-making, as seen in my analysis of customer behavior using statistical testing and in developing a VR-enabled 3D model of a campus.

I'm eager to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of data science and AI, and to contribute to open-source communities. Let's connect and explore how we can innovate together!"

This bio highlights your academic background, professional experience, technical skills, and passion for data science and AI. It also encourages collaboration, reflecting an openness to new projects and community involvement.
